# WordAnalysis
# Project Highlights
File Handling: Efficiently reads and processes the provided crosswords.txt file.

Word Length Analysis: Identifies and prints words with more than 20 letters.

Palindromes: Implements a function (isPalindrome()) to identify palindromes. Counts and prints the number of palindromes, along with the shortest and longest.

Words without 'e': Counts and prints the number of words without the letter 'e,' and identifies the shortest and longest such words.

Frequency Analysis: Explores the frequency of letters as the first letter of words and overall frequency in words. Prints the most frequently-used first letter and analyzes the most frequently-used letter.

# Project Structure:
wordanalysis.py: The Python script containing the code for the entire analysis.
out1.txt, out2.txt, out3.txt, out4.txt, out5.txt: Output files containing the results of different analyses.
